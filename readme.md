# Self-organizing map and its alternatives

Self-organizing map (SOM) and its alternatives can quantize a dataset and extract topology as a network from the dataset.
These programs are Kohonen's SOM, neural gas (NG) (Martinetz, 1991), and growing neural gas (GNG) (Fritzke, 1994).
Kohonen's SOM is a typical SOM algorithm.
In kohonen_2d.py, the network of Kohonen's SOM is a two-dimensional lattice.
NG and GNG are alternatives of SOM.
The network of NG and GNG grows according to a dataset.

- som.py: Kohonen's SOM
- ng.py: Neural gas
- gng.py: Growing neural gas

## Requirement

My programs use Networkx for the manipulation of a networks.
